# Data Analytics and Data Visualisation in Python
This is a competitive data analysis and data visualisation of college entry testing programs in the USA. It looks primarily at data on the participation rates for the ACT and SAT college entry exams.

# Why did you make this?
This research was conducted as an assignment for the Python Programming course I took with General Assembly.

# Why are you sharing this project?
I was honoured to receive full marks for this assignment, and have appreciated having reference assignments when approaching class assessments, so wanted to pay it forward and share here in case it might be useful to future students in the course.

# How to use this project?
You can open the jupyter notebook '1. Data Analysis and Visualisation of ACT vs SAT college entry exams in USA.ipynb' here on github. Github will give you a preview of the notebook. This will allow you to read through the approach to data cleaning techniques, data analysis, data visualisation, and management recommendations. The code is commented throughout to give you an indication of what each part of the code is doing. If you have questions or feedback, please feel welcome to message me.

# What's inside?
The juypeter notebook '1. Data Analysis and Visualisation of ACT vs SAT college entry exams in USA.ipynb' lays out my working process for assessing, cleaning, analyising, and visualising data sets for a management audience. The project shows what every data analyst knows, that while data visualisations get the majority of the praise, it is cleaning and wrangling data thst is the majority of the work.

That said, here's an example of one of the data visualisations in this project üòä

# What was the feedback?
Quantitatively, the assignment received full marks across all categories and overall.
Qualitatively, the lecturer noted:
Lab-Specific Feedback
What went well:
‚Ä¢	Brilliant Effort
‚Ä¢	Great usage of the skills and techniques learnt in class
‚Ä¢	Great effort in joining the data frames which is an important step in this assignment
‚Ä¢	Appreciate your effort in cleaning the Data .
‚Ä¢	Amazing and brilliant Visualizations
‚Ä¢	Loved the correlation coefficients and insights
Areas of opportunity:
‚Ä¢	I really do not want to mention any area of improvement given the effort that you have put in these assignments. There are infinite possibilities for different insights and improvements but given the time we had for project 2 , this work is above and beyond.
WELL DONE !!!
